# Census Income Prediction Project

This project aims to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 per year based on various demographic and socioeconomic features.

## Overview

In this project, we analyze the Census Income dataset to understand the income distribution among different demographic groups. We perform exploratory data analysis to identify key insights and create visualizations. Subsequently, we build machine learning models to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 per year, using various algorithms.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `census_income_prediction.ipynb`.
3. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed by running:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy seaborn scikit-learn
```

4. Execute the cells in the Jupyter Notebook to reproduce the analysis and results.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Census Income dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains income information for over 48,000 individuals from the 1994 US census.

- **Dataset Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/census+income)
- **Format:** CSV
- **Features:** Age, Education, Occupation, etc.

For convenience, the dataset file "census_income.csv" has been included in this repository.

## Usage Instructions

1. Upload the `census_income.csv` dataset to your Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab environment.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `census_income_prediction.ipynb` and execute the cells to reproduce the analysis and results.
